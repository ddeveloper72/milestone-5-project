## Preface

Custom Drone deBug is a fictitious organization that specialize in developing high-tech drone navigation systems.  The navigation systems of our imaginary drones can be programmed and customized to suit our customer's needs.  The drones are used for a variety different industry purposes, such as search and rescue and inspection.  

Customers of Custom Drone, use standard PC based systems to network to their drones by different means.  They are able to communicate by Satellite, 4G, and low frequency radio.  The various Drone models may be tasked to work in a variety of different environments, such as above ground, below ground in cave/tunnel systems and in aquatic environments.  Custom Drone navigation systems facilitate swarm management, establishing satellite peer to per communication in difficult communications environments.

This service provides a facility were customers can report a problem with a drone navigation system.  Problems or bugs can be logged through the Custom Drone deBug portal.  Bugs that have been found in the software will be fixed free of charge and rolled out to all users of that make and model of product.  Our site has a familiar blog look and feel.  Customers that have logged an issue, will be able to upvote a bug report made by another customer in a blog environment.  If there are many upvotes for a particular bug, these are monitored by the product development team will use this data to do as a risk assessment and reassign development time to resolving the bug. Bug resolution is prioritized by the number of votes a bug gets.

Our drone navigation systems are also customizable.  If a new feature is suggested by a customer, the feature can be logged as a Feature Request.  Our product development team will do their best to build this new feature.  There are three categories of software that we work on, namely 'auto-pilot', 'navigation' and 'flight controls'.  Each category will need a specific number of hours for development.  Our costs for assessment, feasibility study, development and testing of the software feature are all inclusive and are reflected in our time required.

## 1. Project Goals

In this project is about utilizing different coding skills to create a usable end product.  In this case, this project is a usable framework, how ever there are many aspects of it that I would like to develop further.

The project uses a django framework, which is the last module of the full-stack framework that was taught.  In it we learned to build as well as import pre-built apps from other projects.  This is what Django lets you do, so that development of a product can be turned around quickly in an ideal development environment.  I've had difficulty with this, so have had to foo some of the nice to aspect so of the development to keep inline with the project brief.

The unfinished work I have down for future is:

  1. Deployment of Slug in my URL patterns (the model framework is in place)
  2. Enabling and using reported and hidden Booleans for blog comments (in the model) - I've used approve or delete for now.
  3. Refining my media queries for transitioning from small to large screen.
  4. Deploying charts for rendering the statistics collected using a product like chart.js
  5. Improving the UX experience with JQuery and more attractive front end imagery.

I believe that the project fulfils the essentials required to meet the brief.  It utilizes multiple apps that use different online services, that come together to form a finished product.  These are outlined in the UX Design below.  This app manages all SQL database CRUD operations well and provides a seamless transition between my local development MySQL database and the Postgresql hosted by AWS through Heroku.  

The app makes use of the Amazon Web Services S3 bucket to host both my dynamic and static files, as well as integrates with Stripe for managing the apps checkout features.  The authentication app is also tied into a Gmail account so that we can facilitate doing a password reset for a user.

I hope that anyone using this app will enjoy using it.  Its is a starter app and has the potential to change and develop.

3. Code Development
   
   ### Running Locally in VSCode

    1. Download and install Python 3.7.2 and install in your windows environment if you haven't already installed the latest version of python.
    2. Create a project environment for Django, by creating a virtual environment. 
       1. Run `python -m venv env`
    3. In VS Code, open the Command Palette (View > Command Palette or (Ctrl+Shift+P)). Then select the Python: Select Interpreter command.
    4. Select the virtual environment python interpreter for your project.
    5. Start the virtual environment from the terminal by typing in:
       1. `env\scripts\activate`
    6. To setup the project files in this new virtual environment, type in:
       1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    7. Create a proc file
       1. `echo web: gunicorn django_debug.wsgi:application > Procfile`
  
    You wil need to setup the environmental variabes in VSCode for production and debug versions of the project.

    Cteate a new project workspace file and add the following infomation into it for running the project in developer mode:

    VSCode Project.cose-workspace

    ```javascript
    {
    "terminal.integrated.env.windows":
                {
                    "DEVELOPMENT": "",
                    "SECRET_KEY": "<my_secret_key>",
                    "ADMIN": "admin_pass",
                    "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE": "drone_debug.settings",
                    "STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE": "<my_stripe_publishable_key>",
                    "STRIPE_SECRET": "<my_stripe_secret_key>",
                    "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "<my_aws_access_key>",
                    "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "<my_aws_secret_access_key>",
                    "EMAIL_ADDRESS": "<my_email_address>",
                    "EMAIL_PASSWORD": "<my_email_password>",
                    "USER": "<MySQL_db_user_name>",
                    "HOST": "<MySQL_locsl_address eg. 127.0.0.1>",
                    "PORT": "<MySQL_locsl_port eg. 3306>"
                },
    }

    ```

    Then in the .vscode folder, locate the settings.json file and add the following infomation into it:

    SCode settings.js

    ```javascript
    {
    "terminal.integrated.env.windows":
                {
                    "DEVELOPMENT": "",
                    "SECRET_KEY": "<my_secret_key>",
                    "DATABASE_URL": "<my_postgres_db_url>",
                    "ADMIN": "admin_pass",
                    "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE": "drone_debug.settings",
                    "STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE": "<my_stripe_publishable_key>",
                    "STRIPE_SECRET": "<my_stripe_secret_key>",
                    "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "<my_aws_access_key>",
                    "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "<my_aws_secret_access_key>",
                    "EMAIL_ADDRESS": "<my_email_address>",
                    "EMAIL_PASSWORD": "<my_email_password>"
                },
    }

    ```
    Update the gitignore file to to exclude the following file types:
    Use the following command line command:
    * `echo env.py >> .gitignore`

   1.  `env`
   2.  `.vscode`
   3.  `config.py`
   4.  `__pycache__`
   5.  `*.sqlite3`
   7.  `.coverage`
   8.  `*.code-workspace`
   9.  `*.pyc`
   10. `*.db`
   11. `*.mwb`
   12. `*.mwb.bak`
   13. `*.mwb.beforefix`

4.  Production Deployment Instructions

    1. Instructions for deployment to a hosing site: [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

    In Heroku - Part 1

    1. Log into Heroku
    2. Select New and Create new App.
    3. Create a App name, select the region.
   
        * then Create app.
  
    4. Select Resources tab, search for add-on
   
        * Add Heroku Postgres SQL database, choosing the free hobby plan.
  
    5. Select the Settings tab, then select Reveal Config Vars
   
        * Verify the new `DATABASE_URL` and value is there for the Postgres database.
        * Add in the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to the heroku Config Vars to enable connection to the AWS S3 bucket
        * Add in the `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE` and `STRIPE_SECRET` keys to the heroku Config Vars to enable connection to Sripe.
        * Add in the `EMAIL_HOST_USER` and the `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` details to the heroku Config Vars for the email password reset system.
        * Copy and paste the key, value, pairs into the workspace settings, but not the Postgres database URL in VSCode used for environmental settings (see above).
        * Add a new `SECRET_KEY` key, value pair from your VSCode environmental settings to the heroku Config Vars.
        * Our static files are not hosted on Heroku, so set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to 1 in the Config Vars.
  
    6. Copy these config Vars from the .vscode/settings.json file and this time include the Postgres URL data.
    7. Don't forget to update the allowed hosts for Heroku in your Django settings file.
    8. Lastly, becasse our code is deployed to GitHub, select the deploy tab in Heroku and connect the app to the GitHub repository.  Then select automatic deploment from the _master_ branch.  This way deployments from VSCode to the master branch, will be automatically pulled by Heroku.

    ```Python

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    os.environ.get('localhost', '127.0.0.1'),
    'ddeveloper72-custom-drone.herokuapp.com'
    ]

    ```

    In VSCode - Part 2


    1. To stat the project using MySQL, load the project as a project workspace.
    or...
    1. To open it using the Postgres production database, right click the project folder in windows and open with VSCode.

    2. In the command line, start the virtual environment for the project.
    3. For deploying our models to the production database (we have already made our development models in MySQL), test connection to the new Postgres database by noting the instructions from the command line.

        * Connecting to the local MySQL database should not occur.
        * There will be an instruction to `run python manage.py migrate`,
        * Then run `run python manage.py makemigrations`
        * Then run `run python manage.py migrate` again.
        * run migrate to create new models on the Postgres database.  The existing migrations will be used.
        * A new superuser will be required for the new Postgres database, run `python manage.py creatsuperuser` and fill in the required superuser details to create  super user.
        * Run the app, `python manage.py runserver` and login as the administrator.  All your db models should be clean and empty.
  

## 4. MySQL / PostgreSQL Database Schema (using MySQL Workbench)

The EER drawing for the project has been divided into two sections, namely the Blog models EER and the Issues models EER.

## 5. Development & Testing

### Testing

The project brief was to follow a a pattern of Test Driven Development. Testing was carried out writing functions and then verify the data returned from the function. In this case, print statements were created to print cursor from a data collection and then print specific objects or key value pairs.

Where CRUD operations were being carried out, the data was verified by watching the updates being carried out to the my local storage managed by MySQL Workbench.

Server codes were used to monitor POST GET transitions from the forms.

#### The following manual tests were carried out

### Debugging Strategy

  I thought that the best way to test this application as I have done in the past, was to run a beta test by putting the application on Heroku and then letting everyone in my college try it. While doing so, I asked for feedback on the application. This is the feedback I got:
    
   ### *Issues Found*

1. The blog page is considered to to be the main front end of the site and wasn't publicly accessible.
2. The main user registration page wasn't showing error messages.  Once the user had registered, the errors remind queued on their profile page.
3. I had trouble counting stats data accumulating in the issues model for the different categories of bugs and features.
4. I had trouble trying to assign a integer value for hours required to do a particular tasks.  There were three different task types and so need 3 different amounts of time assigned to each one.  I was unable to to use a list then refence a time in the model.
5. Colleagues have come back to me with problems that they have noticed with the media queries for transitioning between mobile view, table and larger screens.
6. The shopping cart is meant to be able to align all the items in the cart horizontally, to where it meets the user aside on the right.  This stopped working after all refactored all the injected partials. Instead the shopping cart items line up below each other like to blog cards.
7. I have implemented a 3rd party add-in for using Markdown with the blog entries.  I've noticed how ever that if use `{{ post.get_content_as_markdown|truncatewords:30 }}`, the Markdown text will be sliced if any partial tags are left, they disrupt my html framework.


   ### *The Fixes Implemented*

8. Moved a copy of the blog URL to the public side of the login.  I then removed login required form the `get_posts` view.  I then tested the links on the page to insure the from the insecure/public side of the site, that the user is diverted to the login page.
9. Messaging was added to the registration page and the login page. Messaging wasn't working due to an error with the messaging block tags.
10. I used a django filter find function to find the Boolean values and then used a either count in the html framework, as well as in places, kept the count in the view function.
11. To assign a unit of time to a particular type of work, changed the view functions that log a new feature as well as edit and existing bug/feature.  When the user selected a type of task that was a feature, such as 'Navigation', an if, elif, else function now evaluated the genre, and if it matches the genre chosen; then that genre = hours_required.  The hours_required was then saved to the table along with all the other information needed to log the issue.
12. I am still working on debugging the media queries.
13. I need to implement a change to the cart framework to make the changes.
14. I haven't found a way yet to safety truncate the Markdown text.  For the purpose of this exercise, I have had to remove truncate words till a solution can be found.


## 6. Credits

* There are loads of people that I want to give credit to. These include, first and foremost my family for their support!

* My friends within the Code Institute who go by the Slack handles @robinz_alumni  @JoWings, @Eventret_Mentor, @Miro_lead, @JohnL3_Alumni, @Sonya, , my Mentor, Nishant and tutors as well and many others. You guys have helped me to find my way and personally shared resources like UXD design templates-to help keep my thoughts on task and on track and help with my C9 and VSCode coding environments. Thank you ladies and gentlemen!
